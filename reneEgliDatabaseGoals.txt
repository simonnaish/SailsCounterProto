Rene Egli equipment database:
    • Database of sails(SQLite):
        ◦ for each sail(serial number, category[wc/prem], model, size, year, date(when added), [later: date-first time in database to add parameter new/used]
            ▪ adding sail
            ▪ deleting sail(when SOLD)
            ▪ sending sail to repair(keep in database)
            ▪ searching for sail
            ▪ printing list of sails
    • Database of boards(SQLite):
        ◦ for each board(serial number, category[sport, wc, prem], model, size, year, fin, date(when added), [later: date-first time in database to add parameter new/used]
            ▪ adding board
            ▪ deleting board(when SOLD)
            ▪ sending board to repair(keep in database)
            ▪ searching for board
            ▪ printing list of boards
            ▪ searching for the right fin for board
            ▪ changing fin
    • Database of fins(SQLite):
        ◦ for each fin(serial number, category[wc, prem], model, size, year, board, date(when added), [later: date-first time in database to add parameter new/used]
            ▪ adding fin
            ▪ deleting fin(when SOLD)
            ▪ sending fin to repair(keep in database)
            ▪ searching for fin
            ▪ printing list of fins
            ▪ searching for the right board for fin
            ▪ changing board
        ◦ Goals: 
                • adding/deleting operations managed only by serial number of equipment
                • searching by any possible parameter
                • keeping data directly in sqlite database
                • unique key by number of equipment(for example: BL45201, SRP211)
                • possible offline access do database with update option
                • online access to database from all devices(separate website)
                • in future: creating qr code(only number of sail) and swift+kotlin application for easy management of database 
                • compiled to portable exe file(no other tools needed. Python exec include 
Ease online access to database:

Swift/Kotlin application:
